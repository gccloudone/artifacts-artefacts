# Contributing to Aurora

Aurora planning is tracked in a **private GitHub Project**.  
ðŸ‘‰ Only Aurora maintainers and invited partners can see the board.

If you **donâ€™t have access**:

- Use the **Epic** or **Task** issue templates.
- Aurora maintainers will link your issue to the project during triage.

## Issue Types

- **Epic** â†’ High-level outcome. Use checklists (`- [ ] #issue_number`) to track Tasks.
- **Task** â†’ Individual unit of work. Reference its parent Epic in the issue body.

## Rules for Project Members

If you can see the Aurora project:

1. Add every Epic and Task to the **Aurora Project** (Projects sidebar).
2. Set required fields: **Quarter**, **Category**, **Client / Partner**.
3. Keep **Status** current â†’ To do â†’ In progress â†’ Done (use Blocked/In review if enabled).

## Project Views

| View                | Query                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Backlog**         | `Status = "To do"`             |
| **Active Sprint**   | `Quarter = @current`           |
| **Roadmap**         | `Quarter = @current OR @next`  |

## Access Requests

- Not seeing the Aurora project? Thatâ€™s expected.  
- Contribute issues normally â€” maintainers will handle linking.  
- SSC and partner staff who need board access can request it from the Aurora maintainers.
